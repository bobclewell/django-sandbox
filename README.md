# Objective
Build a super simple discussion application in Django. This app will allow users to create/view topics and contribute to a comment thread for a topic. 
 
# Requirements 
* Needs to use the Django framework.
* Needs to use some form of persistent storage.
* Needs to have a list screen with all submitted topics listed by title and a submission box for new topics. Submitting a topic will commit it to the topic list.
* Clicking a topic on the list screen takes you to a detail screen. The detail screen should include the topic’s title, a long description, a list of comments, and a submission box for new comments. Submitting a comment will commit it to the comment list for the topic.
